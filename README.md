# 🩺 Glucose Level Prediction Project

This project uses the **Framingham Heart Study** dataset to predict an individual's glucose level based on various health indicators.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: `framingham.csv`
- **Features**: Age, BMI, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Smoking Habits, Diabetes, etc.
- **Target**: `glucose` (continuous value)

---

## 🧪 Objectives

1. Import and explore the dataset
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Visualize key relationships
4. Perform feature selection and scaling
5. Train multiple machine learning models
6. Evaluate models using regression metrics
7. Visualize predictions and feature importance
8. Draw actionable insights

---

## 🧠 ML Models Used

- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Features such as **BMI**, **blood pressure**, and **age** significantly impact glucose levels.
- **Random Forest** performed the best with the lowest error and highest accuracy.
- Predictive models like this can support **early diagnosis** and **preventive care**.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Convert regression to classification (e.g., high vs normal glucose)
- Add cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- Use larger clinical datasets for generalization
